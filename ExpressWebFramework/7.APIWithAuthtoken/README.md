# Mongodb with Mongoose library

npm test (for test)
node .\server\server.js (for server starting)

Remember starting mongoDB :
.\mongod.exe -dbpath E:\dev\mongodb\mongo-data\
.\mongo.exe (for command line)

In this case I added the user model, with Auth JWT token 
You can use /mongodb/native/mongodb-insert.js if you need some documents for test. 
You can use postman for valid requests to the API (test API.postman_collection.json is the config collection postman file), 'url' is a variable and it needs initialize in enviroments
